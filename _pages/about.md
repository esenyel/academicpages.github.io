I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in System Engineering at the University of Virginia. I work in Autonomous Mobile Robots Lab and Link Lab under the supervision of Prof. Nicola Bezzo. Before joining AMR Lab, I obtained my MS and BS degrees in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bogazici University, Istanbul in 2016 and 2014 respectively. 

My research focuses on developing techniques to guarantee the **safety** of autonomous aerial vehicles moving under unforeseen conditions such as disturbances, intermittent sensing, model changes and failures. I leverage **reachability analysis** tools, **machine learning**, **runtime monitoring and recovery**, and **self-triggered scheduling** techniques to provide safety guarantees while adapting to the unforeseen changes. 

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, yoga, collecting vintage photographs, watching independent movies, and  traveling.
